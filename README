# Conway's Game of Life in C++

This is a terminal-based implementation of Conway's Game of Life written in C++. Conway's Game of Life is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. This implementation also uses a randomized initial state instead of prompting the user for input.

## Rules of the Game

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/terminal-game-of-life.git

2. Navigate to the project directory.
   ```bash
   cd terminal-game-of-life

3. Compile the program with the latest standard of C++.
   ```bash
   g++ -std=c++20 life.cpp -o life

4. Run the program.
   ```bash
   ./life

5. Watch as the game progresses through generations based on the rules mentioned above.

## Enjoy!
